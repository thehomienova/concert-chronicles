# Concert Chronicles

Concerts and music festivals are some of my favorite things to attend. I'm always looking for the next one and find myself reminiscing about past shows. In this portfolio project, I showcase a few of my most unforgettable concert experiences.

### Sections:
- **Unforgettable Shows** - Hero section
- **Top Four** - Info section
- **Quote** - Quote section
- **Call to Action** - CTA section
- **Footer**

I built this using HTML and CSS, experimenting with flexbox for layout. My goal was to create a page from scratch about something Iâ€™m passionate about.

Thank you for checking it out!
